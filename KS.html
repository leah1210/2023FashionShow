	    <p>My love for fashion began at an early age. Growing up, I was always interested in the way people dressed and how their clothing reflected their personalities. I loved to look at fashion magazines and dream about all the different outfits I could create. I also loved to watch fashion shows and see what the new trends were. When I was in high school, I began to take fashion seriously. This is when I started to express myself through my outfits. I was so passionate about it that I decided to pursue a degree in fashion design. I am now a senior at Stevenson University and graduate in May 2023. I have worked in the fashion industry from working at a bridal shop to helping local fashion designers with prom dresses to even doing prom dresses myself. My love for fashion has continued to grow over the years. I am always eager to learn more about the industry and keep up with the latest trends. I am passionate about helping people express themselves through their clothing and inspiring them to be creative and confident. </p>

		    My concept for my collection, <strong>Street Couture</strong>, is inspired by the dynamic and creative streetwear culture. I focused on bright colors, and unique silhouettes. Bold, cutting-edge designs are the main focal point of my collection featuring puffer components, wide-legged pants, corsets, and asymmetric hemlines. This collection also includes couture aesthetics, such as feminine elegance, fitted bodices, and delicate yet edgy fabrics. My collection was designed to reflect the urban lifestyle, with a mix of streetwear and couture pieces that can be dressed up or down to fit any occasion.â€¯
