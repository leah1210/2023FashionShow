	    <p> grew up as a military child, In high school I struggled to find clothes that fit and so I have lived in a few places. I was raised in Oklahoma, then I moved to Maryland and started middle school.  I was born with eczema so moving to Maryland really gave my skin a 180. I had a hard time expressing myself, so I gravitated toward the art field because it was calming and manageable. I liked art so much in middle school, so I explored the other avenues in the art world like dancing, modeling, fashion, and music. I never really focused on fashion as much as I did dance and music untii the fit and the feeling of my clothes became an issue. That's when I really gravitated toward clothing stores. Being in high school I struggled to find clothes that fit and that would not itch my skin while still looking stylish. From there I wanted to find clothes that were my style, but everything in the store was repetitive and not for me. It wa sat that point that I knew I was interested in fashion. I also loved watching fashion tv shows, playing online fashion games, and looking at what all the fashion icons had on. After high school, I went to college for a little while and then transferred to Stevenson University to study fashion and fashion merchandising. I learned the process of creating a garment, I took a history of fashion internship and worked at a few retail stores to learn about the business side of fashion. To this day I am continuing to venture into the fashion and business world and see what it has to offer me. </p>

  The name of my collection is <strong>STEP up, STEP out and STEP into Me</strong>My fashion collection concept was to take each outfit and combine my story with my inspiration and take the elements such as the fabric, the color, the silhouette, and the style to portray my idea. The whole collection defines my collection title.  In life I had to step up to my problems, step out of my comfort zone and step into who I truly am in order to get to where I wanted to be. My inspiration came heavily from the movie franchise Step Up, specifically Step-Up Revolution. Step-Up Revolution is a dancing movie which is something I did to express myself. So, in my collection, I focused on hip-hop dancewear and streetwear to show who I am. Therefore, I played with trends such as utilitarian style, oversize looks, color-blocking, appliqu√© patchwork, and asymmetry. Additionally, I focused on Step Up Revolution because it was filmed in Miami, Florida. All the fabrics I chose have to do with the weather and the vibes that Miami brings. For the warm weather, I incorporated lightweight fabrics and outfits that show the skin more. Additionally, I incorporated water-resistant fabrics with the rain element to bring the idea that it rains in Miami. Also, I incorporated stretchy fabrics and vibrant fabrics to add to my ideas and inspiration. </p>
